### 1. Problem Definition
To analyse the temporal nature of tea prices in the training dataset and forecast the weekly average tea price for the 29 weeks mentioned in the test set.

### 2. Dataset
Data is taken from [MachineHack Competition](https://machinehack.com/hackathons/teastory_weekend_hackathon_edition_2_the_last_hacker_standing/overview)

Train.csv ‚Äî 544 rows x 15 columns (includes ‚ÄòAverage‚Äô as a target variable)

Test.csv ‚Äî 29 rows x 15 columns

### 3. Evaluation
The submission will be evaluated using the RMSE metric. One can use One can use ‚Äònp. sqrt (Mean Squared Error)‚Äô to calculate the same.

### 4. Modeling
After cleaning and imputing all the missing values in the dataset. I tried various Regression models, but two models performs well,  
- **GradientBootingRegressor** with **RMSE of 2.66**
- **CatBoostRegressor** with **RMSE of 3.34**.
